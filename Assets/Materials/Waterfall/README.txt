Main Waterfall material is a normal material. You can mess with pretty much any of its values. 

The foam material is a material VARIANT of the main waterfall material. 
To create that right click on the main waterfall material, go to "Create" 
and then find and click on "Material Variant".

The foam material is setup this way because most of its values should be the same as the waterfall material and 
since it is a Variant of the waterfall, if you update the waterfall material the foam material should also update.

The values that are ok to change on the foam material is "Cast Shadows", "Ripple Color", "Ripple Power", "Foam Edge", and "Erosion".
The other values in most cases should be left alone. If you accidentally change something and want it to be like the waterfall material again
you can right click on it and click "Revert".

The ripple material is based on its own seperate shader so you can changes its values however you want.
